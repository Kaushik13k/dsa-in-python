    "The while loop inside the for loop does have an effect on the time complexity of the code, but it does not change the overall time complexity, which remains O(n). Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop is used to pop elements from the stack until a certain condition is met (specifically, until the current element is greater than or equal to the element at the top of the stack). In the worst case, the while loop may run multiple times for a single element in the list, but the total number of times the while loop runs across all elements in the list is still linear with respect to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is that each element is pushed onto the stack once and popped from the stack at most once. Therefore, the time complexity is still dominated by the single loop that iterates through the entire list once, which is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the while loop inside the for loop does impact the actual number of iterations within the loop, it doesn't change the overall time complexity of the algorithm, which remains O(n)."
